# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
### Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to see if the Amazon reviews written by members of the paid "Amazon Vine" program is causing the reviews to be skewed in any way when compared to people that are not part of the Vine program. 

In this challenge we will pick a dataset of our choosing, and perform an ETL process. we will extract the dataset, transform the data so it can be easily used, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. From there we will use PySpark to determine if there was any bias in the reviews from the Vine members in the data we looked at. 

Due to my interest in cars and motorcycles I chose the Automotive dataset, which can be found [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Automotive_v1_00.tsv.gz)
### Results
* How many vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were here
* How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
* What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
